# Milestone v0.1 — Foundation and First Playable

## Milestone summary

**v0.1** establishes the technical and gameplay foundation of the project and delivers the **first playable sandbox encounter** on mobile browsers.

This milestone focuses on correctness, architecture alignment, and performance baselines rather than content volume or polish.

By the end of v0.1, the project should support:

* Flying a ship in a 3D space arena on a mobile device
* Fighting a small number of intelligent enemies
* Using a targeting assistant suitable for touch and gyro input
* Completing a simple stage and receiving rewards

## Goals

1. Create a stable project skeleton aligned with `docs/architecture.md`
2. Prove mobile-first controls and performance
3. Implement the core combat loop with targeting assistance
4. Deliver one complete sandbox stage end-to-end

## Non-goals

The following are explicitly **out of scope** for v0.1:

* Multiple stages or progression trees
* Extensive content variety
* Advanced visuals or postprocessing
* Save/load persistence
* Boss fights
* Mod support

These will be addressed in later milestones.

## Deliverables

### Technical foundation

* Vite + TypeScript + Three.js project bootstrapped
* ECS-style world, entities, components, and system scheduler
* Centralized tuning configuration
* Typed event bus
* Content loading and validation framework

### Input and movement

* Mobile touch input (dual-stick)
* Optional gyroscope aiming with calibration
* Arcade-style flight controller:

  * constant forward motion
  * strafe and vertical movement
  * boost with cooldown

### Combat systems

* Weapon framework with shared interface
* Laser weapon with heat and cooldown
* Missile weapon with target lock
* Projectile or hitscan pipeline
* Damage, shield, and destruction logic

### Targeting assistant

* Automatic target selection near crosshair
* Sticky targeting with hysteresis
* Visual target indicators
* Mild aim assistance (soft lock or magnetism)

### Enemy AI (v1)

* At least one enemy archetype
* AI perception, decision, and steering layers
* Tick scheduling for AI updates
* Enemies react to player position and actions

### Sandbox stage

* One arena-style stage
* 3–5 enemies with increased health
* One clear objective (e.g. eliminate all enemies)
* Credits rewarded on completion

### UI and debugging

* Minimal HUD:

  * crosshair
  * health and shield bars
  * weapon state
* Debug overlay toggle:

  * FPS
  * entity counts
  * current target info

## Acceptance criteria

The milestone is complete when all of the following are true:

1. The game runs on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
2. Player can control the ship smoothly using touch input
3. At least one complete sandbox stage is playable end-to-end
4. Targeting assistant reliably selects nearby targets
5. Combat feels responsive without major performance drops
6. No critical runtime errors during normal play
7. Code structure matches `docs/architecture.md`

## Performance targets

* Target: ~60 FPS on mid-range mobile devices
* No visible GC spikes during sustained combat
* Entity countswhile under control (few enemies, pooled projectiles)

## Planned tickets (indicative)

The following tickets are expected to make up v0.1:

1. Project bootstrap and build setup
2. ECS world and system scheduler
3. Mobile input abstraction
4. Flight controller system
5. Event bus and lifecycle hooks
6. Content schema and loader
7. HUD v1
8. Enemy entity and basic AI
9. Targeting assistant (selection)
10. Targeting assistant (assist)
11. Weapon framework and laser weapon
12. Missile weapon and lock logic
13. Damage and destruction system
14. Single sandbox stage implementation
15. Debug overlay

Exact ticket breakdown may change, but scope should remain stable.

## Risks and mitigation

**Mobile performance risk**
Mitigation: limit enemy count, use pooling, stagger AI updates, avoid heavy shaders.

**Input usability risk**
Mitigation: tune targeting assistant early, allow sensitivity adjustments.

**Scope creep risk**
Mitigation: defer polish and content expansion to v0.2.

## Exit criteria

v0.1 is considered closed when:

* One sandbox stage is playable and enjoyable
* Architecture is validated by real gameplay
* The codebase is ready for content and progression expansion in v0.2
